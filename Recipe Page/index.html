                    <span>  
                        Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
                    </span>
                    
                </div>

                     <span> 
                        Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham<br>
                        crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar <br>
                        and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all <br>
                        together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly <br>
                        into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch <br>
                        springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom <br>
                        of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 <br>
                        minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large <br>
                        piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the <br>
                        water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling
                    </span>

                <span>  
                    Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a <br> 
                    paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar <br> 
                    together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture <br> 
                    is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, <br> 
                    vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On  <br> 
                    medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each <br> 
                    addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into<br> 
                    the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from <br>  
                    deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

                    <span> 
                        Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. <br> 
                        You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath,<br> 
                        so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.<br> 
                        As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the <br> 
                        springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.<br> 
                        Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.<br> 
                        Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the<br> 
                        hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can<br> 
                        place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water<br> 
                        in. Whichever is easier for you.)

                    <span> 
                        Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost<br> 
                        set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly<br> 
                        wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open<br> 
                        the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the <br> 
                        water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and <br> 
                        water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room<br> 
                        temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours<br> 
                        or overnight.
